PROTOTYPE by Jon Wilson (10yard)

The arcade version of Donkey Kong is adapted for 2 player co-operative gameplay.
For x64 Windows only. 


Features
--------

o 2 players are controlled independently

o Each player gets their own hammers

o Player 1 gets the barrel control.  Player 2 doesn't control barrels but gets the advantage of 
    not being targeted by barrels or fires.

o Pulling rivets is fun with 2 players sharing the task and it reduces some of the difficulty.

o If one player completes the stage then both players complete the stage together but the player 
    completing the stage gets the bonus points - unless you finish exactly at the same time.

o Both players accrue points independently but there is a combined score displayed in the centre.

o If one player dies then both players die.
